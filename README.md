### [Fork this repository](https://github.com/maxwellpollack/juce-plugin-ci/fork) to start a new JUCE audio plugin project on Github.

It contains a JUCE audio plugin template, and automatically builds cross-platform binaries every time you push.

#### To publish a new Release, tag your commit with a version number before pushing:
```shell
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin main --tags
```

---

It borrows the boilerplate audio plugin code from [`JUCE/examples/CMake/AudioPlugin`](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/master/examples/CMake/AudioPlugin), and adds
1. a CMake `FetchContent` call to automatically download and link the JUCE library, and
2. a GitHub Actions script which automatically builds (with CMake) and tests (with CTest) the audio plugin for 64-bit MacOS, Windows, and Linux platforms on every push.
